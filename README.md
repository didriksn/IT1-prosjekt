# Auction Guess — Art Price Game

Open `index.html` in a browser to play a small game where you guess how much artworks sold for at auction.

Gameplay:
- The page shows an artwork (image, title, artist).
- Enter your USD guess and submit.
- You can reveal the actual sale price (and points) and move to the next round.
- Game is 5 rounds by default; closer guesses score more points.

Notes:
- Images are pulled from Unsplash for demonstration; an internet connection is required to load images.
- To change artwork data, edit `script.js` and update the `artworks` array.
